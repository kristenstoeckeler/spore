## Welcome to Spore!
Spore is a project I'm working on. I'm a big environmentalist and I'm passionate about finding ways to address the climate crisis. I always felt it would be handy to have an app that I could check in with every day letting me know of relevant and timely actions I can take to support local environmental and climate campaigns. Spore is aiming to be just this app! It's in its baby phase, but feel free to poke around and check back soon for new developments! 

So far it's a Typescript React app using Next.js and Vercel Postgres.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
